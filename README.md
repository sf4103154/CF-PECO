## Install

1. Download the source code.
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/sf4103154/CF-PECO.git</pre></code>

2. Compile the stereo algorithms based on the pre-mentioned instruction and copy the installed algorithm into 'block_stereomatching' folder under root folder and config the 'stereo.json' file to assign the location of each algoirhtm.

3. Compile the .mex file of the stereo matching algorithm by using matalb in-built compile function.
## Demos

### Synthetic Data

config the config_blender.json file for parameters, specify the scene choosen and the algorithm of stereo matching.

<pre><code> run main_blender_demo.m </pre></code>

### Real Scene Data

config the config_real.json file for parameters, specify the scene choosen and the algorithm of stereo matching.

<pre><code> run main_realscene_demo.m </pre></code>

## Add extra scene data (Optional)
1. create the modeld and save as .blend file
2. attach the <pre><code> viewcapture.py </pre></code> script to the blender srcript tab and save it.
3. put the scene file into <pre><code> \blendermodel</pre></code> folder
4. copy the <pre><code>main_blender_demo.m </pre></code> and change the scene intial camera view variables and scenen range variables (at the top of the .m file) accroding your demand.

## Adjust the PECO algorithm parameters (Optional)
you can change the parameters of the PECO algorithm in the json file <pre><code> peco.json </pre></code> in the root folder.
